Redesign Seattle Startup Weekend - 3rd Place Winner

FastBar is an event process improvement company. Eliminating the need for bartenders to handle cash or credit cards directly, FastBar utilizes RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) wristbands that are scanned by a reader at the bar. The bartender doesn't have to worry about making change, swiping a card, or handling drink tickets.

##Usage

Register at www.fastbar.co, then get in line at the bar (but not for long!). The bartender will use the iPad app to select your drink, then scan your wristband or just tap it at the RFID reader. You will be charged, the data will be sent back to the web app, and a receipt will be emailed to you at the end of the night.

The bartender can then view the data of the night's earnings and sales at a location only accessible to them.

Fastbar- Get your liquor quicker!
